Information Storage and Retrieval System to combine the results from Facebook and Twitter

This project is a team project. We try to build an information retrieval system that given the userâ€™s query, 
the system could show the results of both Facebook and Twitter. 
Using Facebook4J and Twitter4J APIs, we crawl the data. And then build the index for all documents. 
Finally, rank the results based on Query Likelihood Model.
